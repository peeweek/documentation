# Events, Logic and Actions

Events, Logic and Actions are Scripts that can connect together to perform Level Scripting Logic. These Scripts use **Callable** lists to perform the link of the calls.

* Events are triggered from Gameplay Events and will perform Calls
* Logic are triggered from Calls, and will trigger other Calls based on Conditions or other logic.
* Actions are triggered from Calls and will trigger game changes.

## Adding and Editing Game Logic

Game Logic Components can be added to game objects just like any other MonoBehaviour, through the Add Component menu. 



## Previewing the hierarchy of calls

You can preview the hierarchy of calls in editor by using the [Callable Tree Explorer](callable-tree-explorer.md) Window. This window allows you to get an overview of what's being called.

You can also enable Verbose Call Logging in the Gameplay Ingredients Settings asset
